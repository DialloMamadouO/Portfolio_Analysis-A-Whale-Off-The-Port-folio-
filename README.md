# Portfolio_Analysis-A-Whale-Off-The-Port-folio-

In this project, we will conduct a performance comparison between the algorithmic trading portfolios, the whale portfolios, and the S&P 500. We will use quantitative analysis techniques with python and pandas to determine portfolio performance across many areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. 
We will analyze the data to see if any of the portfolios outperform the stock market (the S&P 500).
We will create an analysis notebook that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. We will use daily returns from the algorithmic trading portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds as well as the S&P 500 closing prices. We will then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios and the S&P 500.
